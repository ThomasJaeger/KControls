   For Rad Studio XE2 and later add VCL and VCL.Imaging namespaces to Unit Scope Names.

INFO FOR CONTRIBUTORS:
-------------------
You may contribute to this project, in such case send your contributions to the author.
Before sending, be sure to test your contribution thoroughfully.
As KControls is cross platform and cross IDE, ALWAYS test your contribution in following
minimum configuration of IDEs and OSes:
1. Delphi 7 and latest Delphi XE version under Windows 7 or higher
2. Lazarus32 and Lazarus64 under Windows 7 or higher
3. Lazarus32 or Lazarus64 under some version of Linux, preferrably Ubuntu or Kubuntu.
Keep in mind the differences between Delphi and Lazarus (mainly string encoding UTF16 in Delphi vs. UTF8 in Lazarus).
When working with texts, always test with different Unicode characters.
Testing of BiDi features is not required, because they are not supported by KControls.
