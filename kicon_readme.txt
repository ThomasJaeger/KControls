Software: TKIcon component for Delphi
Original authorship: Tomas Krysl (tk@tkweb.eu)

NOTE:
-------------------
This readme only covers the KMemo component.
Refer to kcontrols_readme.txt for installation requirements and other information.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
-------------------
CopyToBitmap does not work good in Delphi for 32 bpp images with alpha channel and in some versions of Lazarus.
Reason is errorneous TBitmap implementation.

I expect problems with the LoadFromAssoc... methods, although I’ve tested the methods heavily. 

I have implemented these through the direct access to the registry, because other approach 
(Shell) frustrated me.


PLANNED:
