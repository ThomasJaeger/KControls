Software: KGrid component for Delphi and Lazarus
Original authorship: Tomas Krysl (tk@tkweb.eu)
-------------------

NOTE:
-------------------
This readme only covers the KGrid component. 
Refer to kcontrols_readme.txt for installation requirements and other information.

PLANNED:
-------------------
- filters (still a TODO, partially can be implemented now via editable fixed rows)
- multiple disjunct selections (like Excel, still a TODO)
- tree columns

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
-------------------
Delphi common:
 -none, best performance

Lazarus common:
 -KDBGrid demo does not draw unicode fields correctly for certain databases. 
  applies for all data aware controls, not just TKDBgrid
  must be FPC/TWideStringField bug 
 -printing/Previewing works correctly in Win32 and Qt (for Lazarus versions with my implementation
  of affine transformations for device contexts). For GTKx printing via TPostScriptPrinterCanvas,
  there is no way to effectively implement affine transformations because this canvas is not implemented
  via a device context mechanism. 
  
Target specific:
Win32: 
 Delphi: 
  -none 
  -tested on Windows 98SE (some time ago), Windows XP 32bit, Windows Vista 32bit
 Lazarus: 
  -transparent editor underpainting incorrect if TKGrid is placed onto TPageControl (LCL problem)
  -tested on Windows XP 32bit
Win64: none
 -untested, help appreciated!
WinCE: 
 -slow inplace editor performance (depending on device)
 -tested partially, help appreciated!
GTK: 
 -bad check box painting, bad selected range color, drag window flickers, sometimes infinite painting, 
  sometimes clipping problems (all LCL/GTK problems)
 -tested on Ubuntu Jaunty
GTK2: 
 -slightly slow inplace editor performance with huge grids (GTK2 problem)
 -scrollbar arrows don't work correctly sometimes  (GTK2 problem)
 -tested on Ubuntu Jaunty
QT: 
 -slightly slow inplace editor performance with huge grids
 -checkbox not transparent (cannot be solved)
 -scrollbar arrows behave differently (cannot be solved)
 -tested on QT4.5.2/Windows XP
Carbon: 
 -none
 -untested, help appreciated!
